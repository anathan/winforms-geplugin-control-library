= Introduction =

This class provides a simple, managed, way to set the various plug-in options.

= Details =

This wrapper class works by converting all the google earth plugin COM getter and setter methods to equivalent managed properties. For an example of this, please compare the standard Api methods for dealing with !TerrainExaggeration against the manged properties which handle it.

javascript 
{{{
// where 'ge' is a COM object (GEPlugin)
var options = ge.getOptions();
var terrainExaggeration = options.getTerrainExaggeration();
options.setTerrainExaggeration(2); 
}}}

managed
{{{
// where 'ge' is a dynamic type wrapping the GEPlugin COM object 
GEOptions options = new GEOptions(ge);
int terrainExaggeration = options.TerrainExaggeration;
options.TerrainExaggeration = 2;
}}}
