= Introduction =

This class provides a simple, managed, way to work with the plugin tour player control.

= Details =

This wrapper class works by converting all the google earth plugin COM getter and setter methods to equivalent managed properties. For an example of this, please compare the standard Api methods for dealing with !CurrentTime against the manged properties which handle it.

javascript (public api)
{{{
// where 'ge' is a COM object (GEPlugin)
var tourplayer = ge.getTourPlayer();
var currentTime = tourplayer.getCurrentTime();
tourplayer.setCurrentTime(99);
}}}

c# (managed code)
{{{
// where 'ge' is a dynamic type wrapping the GEPlugin COM object 
GETourPlayer tourplayer = new GETourPlayer(ge);
double currentTime = tourplayer.CurrentTime;
tourplayer.CurrentTime = 99;
}}}
